Hi, my name is

I'm a Software Engineer.

In my spare time I like to work on personal projects, on myself and my daily routines.

These new technologies have allowed me to learn new programming languages and improve others from C# .NET to Solidity (for Smart Contracts in Ethereum). I am also working in React JS and Javascript in general.
